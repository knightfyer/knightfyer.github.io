		<h1>Home of The Skruncheeeze, my Rainbow Tribe!</h1>

		<p><span style="color:#c44cc4;font-weight: bold;">WELCOME;<br>
		It all started with the birth of twin granddaughters, the Skruncheeeze! This is the nickname Ummi aka Khara Knight gave these cute lil skrunchy monkeys.  Since there had never been twins in either side of their families, they were considered a heavenly gift! They even had heavenly names. Of course, for our stories the names were changed to allow for imagination to take place. They are a blend of 3 different races and the combination is most beautiful. More Skruncheeeze were born blending races and making them all so colorful and wonderful and why they are called my Rainbow Tribe!</span></p>

		<p><span style="color:#8761e4;font-weight: bold;">Lil~H & N~Lee are the twins that started the storykeeping and telling. They were just so cute & skrunchy, Ummi={grandma} started drawing cute lil pics of the girls, then added lil stories to go with the cute lil pics.
		Because of their uniqueness, their adorableness, and their love for their Ummi, she eventually created a little book for them. There were also songs she sang sweetly to get them to sleep, or encourage them to play!</span></p>

		<p><span style="color:#6076e3;font-weight: bold;">Now we've progressed from the cute lil hand~drawn, stapled together books that she made for keepsakes, to being officially published on Amazon; would love to follow up with more as time permits. There are just so many more stories to be told. 10 Lil Skruncheeeze now in Ummi's life have their owns stories to tell the world. Ummi (& Mos Def) says, "Shine your light on the world, shine your light for the world to see!" </span></p>
